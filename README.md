## **About**

gider.im is a free, privacy-focused income and expense tracking application. It provides a simple, ad-free solution for users. The app emphasizes user privacy, encrypts data locally, and doesn’t track or sell your information.

## **Vision**

My vision is to offer a reliable, free platform for managing personal finances that puts privacy first. I aim to build a sustainable app powered by donations from users who support my mission to provide an ad-free, secure experience. I believe in creating a community around open-source software and giving back to the community.

## Environment configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root to provide the Supabase credentials used by the application:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-project-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```

Restart the development server after updating these values.

Enable the **Anonymous Sign-in** provider in your Supabase project's authentication settings. The app creates an anonymous
session to satisfy the row-level security policies and attaches the authenticated `user_id` to new records.

You can override the default development server port (`5171`) by setting the `PORT`
environment variable when starting Vite:

```bash
PORT=5173 pnpm dev
```
